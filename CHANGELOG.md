## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- `/jev catalog` groups the models auto-model can route to by quality tier, highest first, across all providers, in aligned columns. Suppressed versions (one line per newer replacement) and models excluded by the tier file are listed after the tiers, and the header totals each status.
- Tier overlay file (`~/.pi/agent/jev-model-tiers.json`) now supports an `exclude` array to permanently disable models, separate from tiering. Useful for models the user cannot access.

### Changed
- Development dependencies on `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `pi-coding-agent`, and `pi-tui` now track `^1.0.0`, so the repo's catalog scripts see the same models as an installed Pi 1.0.0. Peer dependencies are unchanged.
- **Cross-tier version suppression.** Model suppression now compares versions across all tiers, not just within each tier. Within a provider and family, only the newest version survives routing, whatever its tier. Tier 5 (frontier) models are still gated to explicit frontier requests.

### Fixed
- Auto-model now drops a model that fails on SDK-backed providers such as Z.ai. Those providers throw before `after_provider_response` fires, so the router never saw the failure. It now reads the failed turn at `agent_end` and switches models before Pi's auto-retry.
- Plan-entitlement errors ("subscription plan does not yet include access", sent by Z.ai as a 429, or "you do not have access to this model") back the model off for 7 days instead of one quota window. Backoffs are kept in memory, so in practice this lasts the rest of the session. Missing access to an organization or API does not count.
- An unrecognized prompt no longer keeps a backed-off current model; routing leaves it even when it would otherwise abstain.
- With auto-model off, a failed turn is still recorded, but no longer sets a "fallback" status for a switch that will not happen.

### Notes
- This fork merges upstream 0.7.0 except two auto-model changes that conflict with its router: cost-aware scoring (#24) and raw-URL detection in prompt text (#19). The 0.7.0 entries for those two do not describe this fork. Auto-model here ranks by Jev fit, quality tier, and quota headroom rather than dollar cost, and the #19 pattern also matches file names such as `README.md`, which would make most coding prompts require a URL-capable model. Reasoning-level mode, the skill-routing fix (#21), and the key-precedence fix (#20) are included. With both `/jev auto-model` and `/jev thinking` on, the reasoning-level change is appended to the routing status rather than replacing it.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- Per-prompt reasoning-level control via `--jev-thinking` / `PI_JEV_THINKING=1` / `/jev thinking [on|off]`. Prompt intent escalates (`high`/`xhigh`) for planning, debugging, security, and review tasks and de-escalates (`minimal`) for short mechanical prompts. The model is never changed, so the prompt-cache identity stays fixed (#22).
- `/jev status` and `/jev` usage list the new thinking mode (#22).
- `modelSwitchCostUsd`, `modelStayCostUsd`, `hasKnownCost`, and `evaluateModel` are exported, and `ModelRouteResult` reports `fit`, `switchCostUsd`, and `stayCostUsd` so the decision is inspectable (#24).

### Changed
- **Auto-model scoring is now cost-aware.** The scorer previously had a single cost reference, `(model.cost?.input ?? 0) * -0.01`, which mixed arbitrary capability points with dollars and left cost at roughly 0.3% of the score; four of the six profiles had no cost term at all. Candidates are now ranked by capability fit, and cost only chooses between models within `FIT_TOLERANCE` of the best fit. Decision granularity is unchanged: still one decision per prompt, no new flags (#24).
- **Cost can no longer downgrade a capability class.** An additive cost term against a bounded fit scale would let a long conversation's cache miss outweigh the entire capability range — a reasoning task could be routed to a non-reasoning model purely because the reasoning one was pricier. Keeping cost as a tie-breaker means price decides only between near-equivalent models (#24).
- **Capabilities are scored only when the profile needs them.** Image and URL points were credited in every profile, so a multimodal model won text-only tasks while being the most expensive option — for `debug this failing test`, a $15/Mtok vision model beat an equivalent $3/Mtok text model. Hard input requirements are now filtered before scoring (#24).
- **Cache misses are priced with the model's real rates** (`cost.input`, `cost.cacheRead`, `cost.cacheWrite`) and the live prefix size from `ctx.getContextUsage().tokens`: switch cost is `prefixTokens * (input + cacheWrite)`, stay cost is `prefixTokens * cacheRead`. Pricing tiers are applied, as pi's own cost calculation does — the bundled catalog tiers 24 models, doubling flagship rates above ~272k tokens. An omitted `cost` is treated as unknown rather than free (it is charged the current model's rates), while an explicit zero cost remains known and free (#24).

### Fixed
- **Skill matching checks requested activity and product scope rather than related topics.** The skill router no longer recommends `setup-pstack` for an exhausted-model routing bug in the live regression corpus, while retaining genuine pstack configuration matches. The shared 0.65 cutoff is unchanged. Added an opt-in live replay and the investigation/evidence in `docs/skill-routing-investigation.md` (#21).
- **Jev API key source precedence aligns origin with the active key.** Non-empty runtime keys set in-session properly override environment keys while preserving source attribution, and empty in-session strings safely fall back to the environment key (#20).
- **URL prompt model routing detects URLs in raw prompt text.** Model routing automatically routes requests containing raw URLs to URL-capable models using `promptHasUrl` regex matching (#19).

### Notes
- Budget-based Anthropic thinking (models without `compat.forceAdaptiveThinking`) is skipped: Pi derives `budget_tokens` from `max_tokens`, which is itself derived from the level, and Anthropic keys the message cache on `budget_tokens`. That claim comes from Pi's own source comment and is not verified against Anthropic's public documentation.
- `FIT_TOLERANCE` is calibrated against the fit scale: wide enough for price to act, narrower than the reasoning (+30) and image (+40) gaps so cost can never overturn a real capability difference.
- When Jev is configured, a switch is additionally gated by one Noul judgment, thresholded by `requiredConfidence(switchCost)`. Jev supplies the probability and code owns the threshold (`P > cost/value`), so no dollar value is assigned to a correct answer.
- The model-switch question is **batched** with the tool/skill questions when `/jev auto` is also on, so a prompt still costs one Jev request rather than two. Auto-model alone also costs one; without Jev it stays fully local and only breaks ties on cost.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- Auto-model routing (`--jev-model` / `PI_JEV_MODEL=1` / `/jev model [on|off]`) dynamically routes incoming prompts across available models based on task requirements:
  - Task signals (long context, speed, URL, high-context fallback)
  - Quota and provider limit error classification (`PROVIDER_LIMIT_PATTERNS`)
  - Automatic fallback on quota exhaustion with cooldown tracking
  - Conservative, opt-in by default
  - Integration with before_agent_start and turn error hooks
- Dynamic topology routing (`/jev topology`) classifies complex tasks into execution topologies:
  - Single-turn, multi-turn, orchestrator-worker, pipeline, or tree topologies
  - Fast local heuristic classification with optional Jev verification
  - Automatic subagent workflow script generation for delegated multi-step tasks
- Subagent RPC task interceptor (`executeJevAgentTask`):
  - Routes `agent: "jev"` calls in subagent configurations directly to Jev
  - Replaces dummy LLM reasoning passes with real calibration checks
- `/jev test <prompt>` now uses a two-phase pipeline:
  - Model design phase: queries the active LLM to generate targeted noul/choice questions with validation
  - Jev execution phase: runs the designed evaluation against the configured Jev endpoint
  - Falls back to fixed smoke test when no prompt is provided
- Token usage tracking:
  - JevClient captures input, output, and cache tokens from SDK responses (snake_case)
  - `/jev status` displays cumulative session token usage and estimated cost
  - Accurate accounting across all evaluation types

### Changed
- Refactored `AgentOrchestrator` to dispatch generated topology workflows via `pi-subagents` RPC
- Model routing tracks selection changes and avoids redundant switches
- Improved error feedback on unconfigured or unreachable Jev endpoints
- Hardened model-router against malformed models and uninitialized active sessions

### Fixed
- Base URL resolution prioritizes `PI_JEV_BASE_URL` over `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`
- Custom endpoint configuration works correctly when API key is not required
- Jev API key resolution prioritizes environment variables over in-session keys
- URL prompt routing respects `promptHasUrl` regex when detecting URL targets in input text

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-23
### Added
- Release pipeline with npm publish workflow
