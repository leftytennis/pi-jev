# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `/jev catalog` groups the models auto-model can route to by quality tier, highest first, across all providers, in aligned columns. Suppressed versions (one line per newer replacement) and models excluded by the tier file are listed after the tiers, and the header totals each status.
- Tier overlay file (`~/.pi/agent/jev-model-tiers.json`) now supports an `exclude` array to permanently disable models, separate from tiering. Useful for models the user cannot access.

### Changed
- Development dependencies on `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `pi-coding-agent`, and `pi-tui` now track `^1.0.0`, so the repo's catalog scripts see the same models as an installed Pi 1.0.0. Peer dependencies are unchanged.
- **Cross-tier version suppression.** Model suppression now compares versions across all tiers, not just within each tier. Within a provider and family, only the newest version survives routing, whatever its tier. Tier 5 (frontier) models are still gated to explicit frontier requests.

### Fixed
- Auto-model now drops a model that fails on SDK-backed providers such as Z.ai. Those providers throw before `after_provider_response` fires, so the router never saw the failure. It now reads the failed turn at `agent_end` and switches models before Pi's auto-retry.
- Plan-entitlement errors ("subscription plan does not yet include access", sent by Z.ai as a 429) block the model for the session instead of one quota window.
- An unrecognized prompt no longer keeps a backed-off current model; routing leaves it even when it would otherwise abstain.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- Custom Jev-compatible endpoint support via `PI_JEV_BASE_URL` or `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`, including unauthenticated local servers such as Laya `laya-serve`.
- `/jev status` now shows the active Jev endpoint.
- OpenCode Zen URL-aware model routing.

### Fixed
- `pi-jev-gate` runtime loading now works from package installs without dev dependencies in the caller cwd.
- `/jev status` reports the real API key origin and counts SDK `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` usage.
- `--jev-auto-model` and `--jev-agents` take effect independently of `/jev auto`.
- `/jev auto` now sends one Jev request per prompt as documented.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- **Tool Guard**: Opt-in tool call validation and anti-hallucination interceptor (`--jev-tool-guard`, `PI_JEV_TOOL_GUARD=1`, `/jev tool-guard [on|off]`). Evaluates tool parameters with Jev System One to block hallucinated paths/flags and enhances error output with targeted recovery hints.

### Fixed
- **Safe Fallback**: When Jev is unreachable or unconfigured, tool router no longer auto-activates tools blindly and reports 0 probability rather than false certainty (1.0). Skill router only surfaces keyword matches with 0 probability (closes #1: "A failed request activates three tools and reports them at probability 1.0").
- Removed outdated reference to nonexistent `/jev login` in `jev_evaluate` error message.
- Documentation clarifies that heuristic routing (`/jev auto-model`, topology fallback) executes locally without spending Jev requests.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Jev Gate CLI binary (`bin/jev-gate.js`, exposed as `pi-jev-gate` and `jev-gate`) for subagent post-run `gate` checks and CI/CD validation. Evaluates git diff, stdin, or files against acceptance criteria with fast System One noul probability.
- Typed Jev Subagent (`agent: "jev"` / `agentType: "jev"`) handler in `pi-subagents` RPC for sub-second, zero-LLM-overhead choice, score, and probability decisions inside workflows.

### Fixed
- `/jev agents <task>` now directly constructs multi-agent `workflowScript` topologies delegating to builtin agents (`scout`, `worker`, `reviewer`, `researcher`, `evidence-auditor`), replacing single `delegate` subagent calls.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Opt-in automatic model routing via `--jev-auto-model`, `PI_JEV_AUTO_MODEL=1`, and `/jev auto-model [on|off]`.
- Model profiles for fast, balanced, reasoning, long-context, and vision tasks. Selection respects scoped models and attached images.
- Provider-limit handling: quota, rate-limit, timeout, unavailable, auth, and context-limit errors are classified; retry-prone models are temporarily avoided on later prompts without loops or silent truncation.
- Opt-in Jev-guided `/compact` via `--jev-compact`, `PI_JEV_COMPACT=1`, or `/jev compact on`. Important tool history is retained in a custom compaction summary, with Pi's built-in summary as fail-open fallback.
- Explicit agent orchestration via `/jev agents <task>` and opt-in automatic orchestration via `--jev-agents`, `PI_JEV_AGENTS=1`, or `/jev auto-agents on`, using the installed `pi-subagents` RPC.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-17

### Documentation
- Add secret store key resolution option (`~/.pi/agent/secrets/typesafe_api_key`) to Setup section in README.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Dynamic evaluation command: `/jev test <prompt>` (aliases `/jev eval`, `/jev evaluate`) asks the session's active model to design the Jev question schema from the user's prompt, then runs it on TypeSafe Jev. `/jev test` alone still runs the fixed smoke test.
- Automatic mode: `--jev-auto` flag / `PI_JEV_AUTO=1` env var and `/jev auto [on|off]` command run one Jev routing pass before each prompt, activating tools and surfacing matching skills.

### Changed
- Single activation threshold `JEV_THRESHOLD` (0.65) in `src/skills.ts`, used by the router, both tools, `/jev skills`, and auto mode. `/jev skills` previously used 0.6, so manual skill search could show matches auto mode hid.

### Fixed
- Router no longer offers `pi-jev`'s own tools as routing candidates. After `/jev disable`, automatic routing used to re-activate `jev_find_skill` and `jev_evaluate`.
- `/jev` subcommands now match exactly, so `/jev autofoo on` and `/jev skillsfoo` report an error instead of silently toggling or searching.
- `/jev skills` discloses local heuristic fallback instead of presenting 1.00 probabilities as Jev judgments.
- `/jev status` reports where the API key came from (`$TYPESAFE_API_KEY` vs `~/.pi/agent/secrets/typesafe_api_key`) and counts only genuinely routable tools.
- `/jev help` lists usage at info level instead of warn-as-unknown-command.
- Router and skill fallback tests no longer depend on the machine being unconfigured.
- `npm run smoke` passes `-ne` so it no longer collides with an already-installed `pi-jev` copy.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- `jev_find_skill` tool and `/jev skills [query]` command for semantic skill discovery and recommendation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Initial public release of `pi-jev` package for the Pi coding agent.
- `jev_find_tools` tool for semantic candidate shortlisting and additive tool activation.
- `jev_evaluate` tool exposing typed TypeSafe Jev decisions (Choice, Noul, Score).
- `/jev` slash commands (`status`, `enable`, `disable`, `test`).
- Bounded TypeSafe client integration with safe error handling and usage accounting.
- Comprehensive unit test suite and CI workflows.
